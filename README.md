# Adversarial Attack on Music Generation

Weihan Xu, Eamon Ma


Introduction:

Recent advancements in text-to-music generation models, such as MusicGen and AudioLM, pose a potential threat to musicians in the music industry. These models can learn to mimic artistic styles, raising significant copyright concerns. In this paper, we first explore these concerns by gathering insights from both musicians and the broader community regarding music generation models. We then propose a novel perturbation-attack-and-finetuning paradigm designed to mitigate style replication in text-to-music generation models. Our evaluations, including both subjective and objective assessments, demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the issue of style mimicry while maintaining the quality of the generated music tracks.
